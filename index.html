    Towards the end of the 2021 spring semester at MICA, my professor tells me that our last project for his class is about utopias. Utopias? So I knew I had to write about San Francisco. I had to write about you.

    When we first met, you were a software engineer living in San Francisco and completing a masters in computer science at UC Berkeley. I never would have thought then that we would begin dating a few months later. Giggling on your bed while playing a game you jokingly called “Stupid Tech” that one time. We would try to make up the most pretentious meanings for failed tech. “The Juicero!” you shouted again and again and really, the stupidity was mine. Is this happiness? Why wasn’t this enough?

    I told you I was beginning to think I was nonbinary the same way you asked you me to crossdress for you. One word confessions. I may have told you then that I couldn’t, that I couldn’t be that for you; but if I were to hear those words from you today in the same way you spoke then, I would say that perhaps I can, that I understand.

    Twitter user @isosteph tweets: "why did i study computer science? well i have a dream of becoming a white tech guy's 3rd consecutive asian girlfriend and smiling quietly on his arm at san francisco parties while he pretends his yellow fever is actually an interest in japanese urbanism." It is the spring of 2021 when I read this, a few months since we last met. Sunk at the sudden realization, or perhaps confrontation of an idea I was not yet ready to face. That I have spent the entire semester drowning myself in endless volumes of critical theory; letting them shout at me again and again about the consequences of colonization, resisting patriarchy, and the future of queerness. Yet there I was reading this tweet, utterly ashamed to say that I was thinking of you.

  <p>
    In Litia Perta’s essay “Against Curation or Losing Your Grip” Perta intentionally disregards conventional structures of writing (grammar, spelling, capitalization, etc.) in order to discuss the idea that “unintelligibility is the risk and it is also the promise” in a process of eliminating oppressive systems in order to build new ones. I have come to understand this is a privilege in itself, the privilege of being unreadable. The idea of unintelligibility presupposes that the value of some thing  is brought about after said thing’s identification. After all, what is value if there is no thing to assign it to. To indulge in unintelligibility is a privilege because it requires that the individual doing the indulging has no additional need for value, implying that they already have what is valuable to them. It is reasonable to conclude then, that if an individual were in circumstances where they did not have everything they needed (food, water, healthcare, therapy, etc.) that unintelligibility becomes a luxury which, while promising, is not a risk they have the option of taking.

    The problem with Gordan’s argument is that it doesn’t acknowledge that objects which aren’t blank can also produce strong gestalt sensations. I recently wrote a formal analysis on Egon Schiele’s Krumau - Crescent of Houses which I felt was a painting that evoked an existential melancholy. But it isn’t entirely clear to me whether the painting exudes a melancholy or if I simply projected mine unto it. What are you thinking when I tell you I can only fit into women’s pants. What do you see when you hold onto my waist?

    In Sally Lynn Maier’s Design Dissection, their thesis dissertation while an MFA candidate at MICA, Maier revealed how minimalism as an aesthetic is used as a subtle signifer of class and taste. Maier conducts research on the visual layouts of nine publications directed at different audiences, finding a correlation between a publication’s print layout and the average income of said publication’s audience. Maier found that the more whitespace on the publication’s layout, the higher the average income was of that publication’s audience. Minimalism, in this context, is stripped of its Swiss Modernist philosophies and therefore its egalitarian intentions.

    Maier’s thesis was referenced by Jarret Fuller in their essay Graphic Designers Have Always Loved Minimalism. But At What Cost? who quotes Maier: “You want to keep everything because you might not be able to afford it. Emptiness, on the other hand, shows that you have the luxury to decide what to fill or not fill your space with.”
Fuller continues by saying that “Whitespace is, quite literally, expensive — more whitespace means more pages and more pages means more money.” Perhaps the same could be said about minimalist sculpture. I do not have the privilege to afford making minimalist sculptures. I do not have the luxury of blankness and of silence.

    The day my professor assigned this project to me is also the day I received a scholarship from ArtCenter College of Design. I was trying to transfer colleges and this was enough for me to enroll. Yet it felt forced when I submitted my tuition deposit. Why did it feel so forced?

    I am acutely aware of the implications of the work coming out of ACCD. It is no surprise to me that an art school revolving around a pedagogy of teaching its students to become industry gems, is producing students who consistently generate works that are distinctly ‘minimalist,’ with a lower case ‘m.’ I see it again and again on ArtCenter’s grad show website, ‘tasteful’ typography, left justified texts, Swiss grid systems, all the hallmarks of ‘good’ design wrapped in what art schools call ‘professionalism.’ So while their work reinforces (intentionally or not) the larger hegemonic visual culture, who can blame them? They want jobs. That’s why one goes to ArtCenter. It is also perhaps the reason I am so much more drawn to the work of ArtCenter alumni than I am to RISD’s or MICA’s. It is also to say that by enrolling at ArtCenter, I am participating in my silencing.

    In an interview with Artforum, Judith Butler talks about their book Gender Trouble stating that “What’s not often enough read in my work is the emphasis on power and the intense normativity that governs gender. I was trying to interrogate the painful ironies of being implicated in the very forms of power that one explicitly opposes, and trying to understand what kinds of agency might be derived from that situation.” I reckon that this irony not only applies to gender but class too. To live a life in a painful dissonance where the only real options for me right now is to assimilate, unforgivable, or risk a complete unintelligibility. Isn’t it funny then that no matter what I decide to do, I always end up silent?

    Butler continues: “I think that it’s inevitable that there’s no position outside power, and in that way I’m linked with Foucault; but I don’t think that means one is determined by power relations.” My observations seem to reflect the same truth about power that Butler and Foucault have reached, that is no position outside of power, but I’m curious about the note that followed.

    In an interview titled Power Strategies, Michel Foucault asserts that “It seems to me that power is ‘always already there’, that one is never ‘outside’ it.... [But] to say that one can never be ‘outside’ power does not mean that one is trapped and condemned to defeat no matter what.... [Resistances] are all the more real and effective because they are formed right at the point where relations of power are exercised” (Interview, “Power and Strategies” 141-142). I want to inquire about the latter proposition in relation to nonbinary identities, as it seems to imply that all resistance has its own identity that hasn’t been defined by the entity it intends to oppose. I do not believe this is possible.

    In an essay I am writing about gender and the nature of identity, I reference differential ontology as a basis for arguing that identity is interpersonal and cannot be absolute. Differential ontology proposes that identity does not exist a priori to difference, as opposed to the essentialist view of identity which proposes that difference is merely an observable phenomenon between two entities that already have established identities. I use differential ontology to point out the flawed logic of self-identification as absolute, and that for an identity to have value, it must be in relation to another entity with a different identity. The irony of non binary ness then, as an identity that attempts to separate itself from binary notions of identity, is that it actually becomes its own binary. Not in that it is a part of the man or woman binary, but that it becomes a binary of legibility or non legible identity. It effectively becomes its own symbol not unlike that of man or woman.

    In the same interview, Butler also states this: “Performativity has to do with repetition, very often with the repetition of oppressive and painful gender norms to force them to resignify. This is not freedom, but a question of how to work the trap that one is inevitably in.”

    The act of performance presupposes that there is a performer and an audience. The performance, and therefore the performer, holds a certain power over the audience, as the performer holds control over the performance and it’s execution. An audience ceases to exist if there is nothing to see. This is not to say however, that the audience has no power. The audience is responsible for seeing and watching the performance. The performance ceases to exist is there is nobody to see it. Is performance then, a conflict of power? In the case that the audience does not want to see, or sees the performance in a way not anticipated by the performer, performances become a conflict of power. A contention between the maker and the interpreter. Another possible case however, is that the audience sees the performance the way the performer intended, which in such case, the performance becomes a unison of power. Two forces uniting as a single whole. Power becomes irrelevant. I’d argue that the latter is also a method of working the trap I cannot seem to avoid. It also means to perform for you in the way you want to see me.

    According to Wikipedia, “In 2004, "human capital" (German: Humankapital) was named the German Un-Word of the Year by a jury of linguistic scholars, who considered the term inappropriate and inhumane, as individuals would be degraded and their abilities classified according to economically relevant quantities.” In the context of the idea of human capital, ‘un-wording’ something seems to imply a sort of denial. Look at the current mining of user data and targeted advertising if you want to see human capital outside of the ivory tower. Users are not only the workers that generate data for companies, they are also the product that the company sells.

    In 2014, Facebook rolled out 58 gender options for its users to choose from to complete their user profiles. Users were not allowed to leave the input field blank, forcing them to choose among the options provided. In 2015 due to user complaints, Facebook rolled back on this decision, opting instead for an input box that allowed users to type their own gender identity into their profiles. It comes as no surprise to me that Facebook will not consider getting rid of the gender identifier all together or allow users to leave it blank. How else will they be able to categorize users into certain demographics for targeted advertising? While it might seem like Facebook is being socially progressive, Facebook is, ultimately, a data business. It is in their favor to collect and categorize as much data about its users as they can. Additionally, as a social media company in an increasingly digital world, one might also find themselves in a predicament where Facebook is one of, if not the only option.

    In 2013, Internet.org was launched as a partnership between seven companies, most notably Facebook, with ‘plans’ to increase access to selected Internet services in less developed countries via an app called Free Basics. It was criticized for discriminating against companies not on its list of selected services it allowed access to and later banned in India and detested by the international digital advocacy community Global Voices for its content biases. As of April 2018, 100 million people were still using Internet.org through Free Basics. If all of my friends were using Facebook because it was the only option available, it effectively becomes my only option as well, no matter how far I might remove myself from social media; and in an increasingly digital world, can it even be called an option anymore? So while I’m oddly fortunate to have no friends who use Facebook, the same cannot be said about Instagram (which is owned by Facebook), TikTok, etc. What real choice do I have other than to stuff myself into those boxes that Facebook so desperately wants me to fill?

    One of the most confusing parts about being a second generation East Asian American of any gender is two fold. Firstly that American society generally views all of us as feminine, submissive, docile, and all those other things even if nobody wants to admit it. I dare any disbelievers to go onto any dating app, whether that be Tinder or Bumble or Grindr on the behalf of an individual of Asian descent. Let me know how many people are into ‘soft-bois’ or how many are ‘STR8 4 trans/fem/twink.’ Then let me know how the results change when one presents as a person of East Asian descent that does not match such perceptions of us. Or better yet, go on TikTok and watch a few of those “my dad’s a conservative with an Asian fetish check” videos. The existence of such videos alone are, at the very least, proof that such a phenomenon is common enough to warrant its own TikTok trend. Notice how there aren’t many, if any videos portraying non-stereotypical Asians, whether that be in a good or bad light?

    The second part is a bias towards assimilation that has been instilled within second generation Asian Americns by our first generation immigrant parents. In Immigrant America: A Portrait, Alejandro Portes and Rubén G. propose a framework for describing the assimilation process of immigrants in America. The framework theorizes that immigrants assimilate according to three distinct paths: adapting and integrating into the white middle class, adapting to the underclass and sustained, even permanent poverty, or socioeconomic adaptation through building strong cultural ties within their ethnic community. For straight, cis-gendered Asians living in the West or East Coast, there are only really two viable options. As for Asians of non-normative sexualities and gender identities, just stepping out of the closet is already risking one, if not both of those viable options.

    Critical theory will try to argue that you are fetishizing me and you very might well be. This is not a moral debate about whether yellow fever, exoticism, or whatever we’re calling it these days, is right or wrong. Don’t be fooled into thinking that this is about the larger oppressive structures that made this a problem in the first place. This is about me. Let me be self-centered, let me take the spotlight away from the hierarchical entities that have so long been in the light defining these issues for me. When assimilation is seen as the ultimate, multi-generational goal of all immigrants, go ahead and tell me that I’m feeding yellow fever when the only other option for me is a permanent poverty.

    In Timothy J. Clark’s The Sight of Death: An Experiment in Art Writing, Clark defends his interest in Nicholas Poussin, stating that “Calling an interest in Poussin nostalgic or elitist is like calling the interest one has, say, in the person one cares for most deeply ‘hetero- (or homo-) sexist; or ‘exclusive’ or ‘proprietorial.’ Yes, that may be right: those may be roughly the parameters, and regrettable; but the interest itself may still be more complete and human - still carry more of human possibility and compassion - than interests uncontaminated by any such affect or compulsion.” You may be fetishizing me the same way I may be fetishizing you and unfortunately that is our contaminant. But perhaps it is also one step closer to saying “I love you.”
