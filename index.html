    At the time of this writing, I currently have an unusual affinity for the work of philosopher Jacques Derrida, who became famous for his development of the semiotic analysis methodology he called “deconstruction.” The irony of studying Derrida’s deconstruction is that the very nature of deconstruction prevents it from being concretely defined. Derrida wanted to make it clear that deconstruction was not a philosophical framework or system that served as an ultimatum, but rather that it is a method of identifying and subverting the preexisting assumptions of any given philosophical system. Derrida’s deconstruction is more a tool rather than an idea, and one of which I am trying, and struggling to wield.

    Derrida’s notion of deconstruction reminds me of Descartes’ Meditations, a quite literal deconstruction of Descartes’ entire repertoire of understanding into a new found clarity, and an undoubtedly influential work of metaphysics. Perhaps I am trying to do the same. In fact, I would go so far as to say that clarity is the only reason I write. Writing then, is an act of confession; not in the sense that I am admitting a moral deficiency, but rather an intellectual one of which demands that I first sort through all my bullshit.

    The act of performance presupposes the existence of two fundamental roles: the performer and the audience. After all, performance without an audience is simply action and spectating without something to watch is just sitting. In this sense, performance is a conflict of power, which might lead one to wonder which role is more important to the performance, the performer or the audience? But really, this is a misleading duality. At your apartment, in bright light, in front of the mirror, I am performing for you the way you want to see me and we are both spectators.

    In Timothy J. Clark’s The Sight of Death: An Experiment in Art Writing, Clark defends his interest in Nicholas Poussin, stating that “Calling an interest in Poussin nostalgic or elitist is like calling the interest one has, say, in the person one cares for most deeply ‘hetero- (or homo-) sexist; or ‘exclusive’ or ‘proprietorial.’ Yes, that may be right: those may be roughly the parameters, and regrettable; but the interest itself may still be more complete and human - still carry more of human possibility and compassion - than interests uncontaminated by any such affect or compulsion.” We may both be fetishizing one another and unfortunately that is our contaminant. But perhaps it is also one step closer to saying “I love you.”

    I am making all my words about you sound sweet like when you call me “baby.” Let me acknowledge that when I met you, I may have been naive. Admit that you knew all that I am telling you now when you decided to take off the condom without me knowing. That when I took myself to the hospital that night, you knew I would still be thinking about you while my whole heart was being drained out of me into sterile glass tubes. There is no cure.

    In Of Grammatology, Derrida discusses the historically dichotomous relationship between speech and writing which he observed had been wrongly severed since the time of Plato, who argued that speech was of a sort of ‘pure’ language and that writing was “poisonous” to speech, which unlike writing, required living memory to enact. Derrida points out that this difference between writing and speech is an unsound one, as signification of any sort, be it words or sounds, always refer to other signs. There is no sign that refers only to itself because the process of signification exists as a network of signs, networks which are different from person to person. Words change not only on who says them, but who senses them and how.

    Derrida describes the overlap between speech and writing through a term he called différance, as opposed to “difference.” Distinguishing between the two can only be done in writing. I am trying to write to you just as I am trying to right to myself.

    I reckon this difference can be applied beyond sight and sound. The way you feminize me is, without a doubt, different than when I was mistaken for a woman at the hardware store. The way I say that you were a bad man to my therapist is different from actually realizing you as such.
