    At the time of this writing, I have an unusual affinity for the work of philosopher Jacques Derrida, who became famous for his development of the semiotic analysis methodology he called “deconstruction.” The irony of studying Derrida’s deconstruction is that the very nature of deconstruction prevents it from being concretely defined. Derrida wanted to make it clear that deconstruction was not a philosophical framework or system that served as an ultimatum, but rather that it is a method of identifying and subverting the preexisting assumptions of any given philosophical system. Deconstruction is more a tool rather than an idea; one of which I am trying, and struggling to wield.

    Derrida’s notion of deconstruction reminds me of Descartes’ Meditations, a quite literal deconstruction of Descartes’ entire repertoire of understanding into a new found clarity, and an undoubtedly influential work of metaphysics. Perhaps I am trying to do the same. Writing then, is an act of confession; not in the sense that I am admitting a moral deficiency, but rather an intellectual one that asks me to clarify what I am writing. I would go as far as to say this is the only reason I write.

    Arche-writing is a term used by Derrida in an attempt to bridge the previously dichotomic relationship between speech and writing, which Derrida argued had been falsely severed since the time of Plato. Plato described speech as the purest form of language because it required living memory to enact, while writing was merely a repetition of speech. Derrida uses arche-writing to refer to a sort of language that precedes both speech and writing, arguing that neither were pure or complete. However, the irony of arche-writing seems to me that it came from Derrida, who famously criticized the logocentrism of his and our time: language that expressed an external reality. Consider my writing as proof of the falsity of arche-writing and any other similar notions. I want to make it clear that I am not writing this to demoralize you. I’m writing this because I’m only now capable enough to recognize how much I wasn’t then. But of course I must acknowledge that my portrayal of you is in no way positive. You will read the words “you” and recognize yourself in ways that nobody but you and I can.

    The act of performance presupposes the existence of two fundamental roles: the performer and the audience. After all, performance without an audience is simply action and spectating without something to watch is just sitting. It could be said then that performance is a conflict of power; a contention between what the performer wants to show and what the audience wants to see. This might lead one to ask which role is more important to the performance, the performer or the audience? However, this is a misleading duality. At your apartment on your bed, a few feet away from the mirror and in bright light, I am performing for you the way you want to see me and we are both spectators.

    Is it possible for me to live outside of a gender binary? How does one come to perform or embody nonbinaryness? I sometimes think about that time you asked me to crossdress, wanting to ask if my androgyny was not enough for you; but this question assumes you even see such androgyny. Does anything change when I tell you that I do see and want to perform as such? In an interview between Judith Butler and Artforum, Butler talks about her book Gender Trouble, stating that “What’s not often enough read in my work is the emphasis on power and the intense normativity that governs gender. I was trying to interrogate the painful ironies of being implicated in the very forms of power that one explicitly opposes, and trying to understand what kinds of agency might be derived from that situation.” As agonizing as it is for me to admit, I no longer believer in ever having the power to change how you see me. No amount of words, clothes, or gestures can ever grant me that agency.

    Artist Robert Morris believed that the value of minimalist sculptures was found in their blankness. Without ornamentation or color, minimalist sculptures simply “just stand,” saying nothing and instead relying on the generative forces of the viewer’s imagination to produce meaning. I find this conception of blankness to be at best, utterly worthless. The problem with Morris’s notion, or at least it's worth, is that it seems to rely on two assumptions: that objects can be entirely isolated from signification; and that objects with ornamentation or color cannot also simply exist and produce the same gestalt sensations.

    Derrida’s notion of undecidability and its attempt to reveal the instability of dualisms is one that I have been grappling with on my own for a long time before ever encountering Derrida’s work. There are many examples of things that simultaneously conform or refute either polarity of a dichotomy. A ghost is neither present or absent, or it is both simultaneously. But while the ghost itself may be such, can it really be said that one sees it so? When I think of a ghost, I see a translucent white cloth draped over an invisible sphere, ominously floating in front of a moonlit glass window within the walls of an old, dark house.

    I recently wrote a formal analysis on Egon Schiele’s painting Krumau - Crescent of Houses which I felt was a painting that evoked an existential melancholy. But it isn’t entirely clear to me whether the painting exudes a melancholy or if I simply projected that idea onto what is essentially fabric and oil. What are you thinking of when I tell you I can only fit into women’s pants? What do you see when you hold onto my waist? What does that make me? A man? A woman? An object? For you, there is no conflict. I will ultimately conform to whoever, and whatever you see me as in that moment. This is not because I am changing myself for you, but rather that one’s eyes are essentially filters: selectively omitting and then projecting. This is the cost of being seen.

    I am making all my words about you sound sweet like when you call me “baby.” Let me acknowledge that when I met you, I may have been naive. Admit that you knew all that I am telling you now when you decided to take off the condom without me knowing. That when I took myself to the hospital that night, you knew I would still be thinking about you while my whole heart was being drained out of me into sterile glass tubes. There is no cure.

    In 1977 a petition against the age of consent laws was addressed to the French parliament, calling for the decriminalization of all consensual relations between adults and minors below the age of consent at the time. It was signed by a variety of prominent French intellectuals, most notably Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, and Jean-Paul Sartre among others. Foucault argued in favor of this petition, saying in a radio interview that assuming “that a child is incapable of explaining what happened and was incapable of giving his consent are two abuses that are intolerable, quite unacceptable.” But really, Foucault’s argument follows the same logic as those advocating for racial or gender blindness or neutrality; arguing for racial and gender blindness in an attempt to avoid patronizing such people is also to ignore the historical violence that disadvantages those same people to this day. The social and economic inequalities of gender and racial prejudice don’t need to be proven, for their still being witnessed at the time of this writing. Pretending as though differences in gender and race don’t exist under the guise of avoiding patronizing people affected by such disadvantages is not progressing these issues, it is ignoring them in favor of an impossible ideology. Likewise, age is not simply a number; it carries with it a measure of clarity accessible not from any amount of theory, or education, or words, but of time exclusively. When we first met I fully admit that I was not capable of adequately processing and responding to my circumstances, at least not to an extent that matches yours. This difference is the reason I cannot date older men. I don’t believe acknowledging such a difference is in any way condescending. Some might even describe this difference as wisdom.

    In Of Grammatology, Derrida discusses the historically dichotomous relationship between speech and writing which he observed had been wrongly severed since the time of Plato, who argued that speech was of a sort of ‘pure’ language and that writing was “poisonous” to speech, which unlike writing, required living memory to enact. Derrida points out that this phonocentric attitude against writing is an unsound one, as signification of any sort, be it words or sounds, always refer to other signs. There is no sign that refers only to itself because the process of signification exists as a network of signs, networks which are different from person to person. Words change not only on who says them, but who senses them and how.

    Derrida describes the overlap between speech and writing through a term he called différance, as opposed to “difference.” Distinguishing between the two can only be done in writing, and therefore invalidating the Platonist idea that speech was complete. But allow me to consider a different methodology of reaching the same conclusion. While I can only blame myself for hesitantly saying “stop” in barely audible whispers, there is no hesitation when the word is already loudly written for you to read.

    I reckon that the notion of Derrida’s “différance” can be applied beyond speech and writing. The way you feminize me is, without a doubt, different than when I was mistaken for a woman at the hardware store. The way I say that you were a bad man to my therapist is different from actually realizing you as such.

    Opposites initially seem to negate one another, but upon closer inspection are actually defined by one another. Differential ontology builds upon this notion, asserting that all things can only be defined by their differences. I remember when you, a white, “masc,” straight-passing man broke up with me, leaving me to weep into a sad pillow soaked with salt and shame. I remember reading Fenton Johnson’s essay The Future of Queer, a manifesto criticizing a certain person I then decided was you. Johnson’s distinguishment between being gay and being queer made me want to lean into my queerness, my nonbinaryness as a sort of thing I could be a part of that you couldn’t and could never be. In hindsight however, this is like trying to extinguish a fire with gasoline. This is also how saying “fuck you” also means to say “fuck me;” and evolving the speaker’s cries into an outright sobbing.

    In Timothy J. Clark’s The Sight of Death: An Experiment in Art Writing, Clark defends his interest in Nicholas Poussin, stating that “Calling an interest in Poussin nostalgic or elitist is like calling the interest one has, say, in the person one cares for most deeply ‘hetero- (or homo-) sexist; or ‘exclusive’ or ‘proprietorial.’ Yes, that may be right: those may be roughly the parameters, and regrettable; but the interest itself may still be more complete and human - still carry more of human possibility and compassion - than interests uncontaminated by any such affect or compulsion.” We may both be fetishizing one another and unfortunately that is our contaminant. But perhaps it is also one step closer to saying “I love you.”
